Industrial Energy Optimization &amp; Predictive Efficiency Analysis
__________________________________________________________________________________________
## Project Overview
This project involved the systematic audit and analysis of multi-year energy consumption data for a large-scale manufacturing facility. The objective was to identify operational bottlenecks and implement data-driven strategies to align with global environmental targets and local regulatory standards (Energy Commission/ST).

## Key Impact 
1. Cost Savings: Achieved over MYR 3 Million in annual operational savings.

2. Efficiency: Increased total facility energy efficiency by 20%.

3. Grant Acquisition: Successfully navigated the application process for government green grants, ensuring 100% funding for high-priority resource efficiency projects.

4. Recognition: Contributed to data benchmarks that led to the United Nations World Water Conservation Award.

## Methodology & Technical Approach
1.Eligibility Gap Analysis: Audited operational data to prove adherence to "Green Asset" criteria as defined by MIDA and MGTC guidelines.

2. Stakeholder Liaison: Acted as the primary point of contact between the organization and government bodies (MIDA/DOE/ST) to facilitate technical audits and grant approvals.

2. Data Auditing: Processed over 5 years of historical energy and resource logs (Water, Electricity, Steam) to identify seasonal anomalies and peak-load waste.

3. Bottleneck Analysis: Used statistical trend analysis to isolate inefficient factory asset performance, leading to a redesigned maintenance and depreciation strategy.

4. Compliance Framework: Mapped all operational changes against DOE (Department of Environment) and DOSH safety and environmental regulations.

5. Governance: Translated technical findings into high-level policy briefs for senior management and board members to approve capital expenditure for "Green Tech" upgrades.

6. Financial Reporting: Collaborated with the finance and legal teams to document energy savings as "Qualifying Capital Expenditure," ensuring the project was a profit-driver rather than a cost-center.
